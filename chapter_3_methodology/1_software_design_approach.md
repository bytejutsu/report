## 3.1 Software Design Approach

In this part of the methodology chapter, the emphasis is placed on the use of service classes as a means to enhance the reusability, low coupling, and high cohesion of Livewire components within the project. Furthermore, this approach aligns with the principles of SOLID software design.

Livewire components are typically responsible for handling user interactions, managing data, and rendering views. However, as the complexity of a web application grows, Livewire components may become cumbersome and challenging to maintain. To address these concerns, service classes can be utilized as a way to extract business logic and functionality from the Livewire components.

Service classes encapsulate specific functionalities or operations related to the application's business domain. They provide a modular and reusable approach by promoting low coupling between components and high cohesion within the service classes themselves. By leveraging service classes, Livewire components can focus on handling user interactions and rendering views, while the complex business logic is delegated to separate service classes.

The use of service classes not only enhances the reusability of code but also ensures adherence to SOLID software design principles. The SOLID principles consist of:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Service classes follow the SRP by encapsulating a single responsibility or functionality, ensuring that each class has a clear and well-defined purpose.


- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Service classes are designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for easy integration of new functionalities without modifying existing code.


- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Service classes adhere to the LSP by being substitutable for each other. They maintain a common interface, allowing for easy interchangeability and composability within the system.


- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Service classes follow the ISP by defining specific interfaces that expose only the necessary functionality required by the consuming Livewire components, preventing unnecessary dependencies.


- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Service classes apply the DIP by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This promotes loose coupling between components and facilitates easier testing and maintenance.

By employing service classes in the project's design, the Livewire components become more reusable, maintainable, and adherent to SOLID software design principles. This approach fosters modular development, separation of concerns, and facilitates future scalability and extensibility.
