# Chapter 1: General Introduction

**Introduction**

In today's digital age, the demand for real-time web applications has surged, driven not only by the need for instant communication but also by the desire for efficient business processes. This shift is transforming the landscape of web applications, making real-time features such as instant messaging, push notifications, real-time updates, and live chat essential components. Equally important are features that streamline business operations, such as real-time invoice generation, automatic VAT calculations, and background processing, which enhance user experience in business-centric applications.
