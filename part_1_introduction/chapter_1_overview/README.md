# Chapter 1: Overview

**Introduction**

In the digital age, the demand for real-time web applications has surged, driven by the need for instant communication and constant feedback. This shift is transforming the landscape of web applications, making real-time features such as real-time updates, push notifications, instant messaging, and live chat essential components of modern web applications.

The advent of high-speed network technology has made cyberspace a hub for communication, information sharing, education, business transactions, and social relationships. A [survey](http://iisit.org/Vol6/IISITv6p113-126Chou651.pdf) [^1] in Taiwan revealed that the use of instant messaging (IM) has become the third most frequently accessed online activity, with 66% of online users using at least one type of IM program for communication.

Real-time web applications have found their place in various industries and use cases. For instance, real-time communication has become a staple in many applications, providing users with instant feedback and enhancing their overall experience. In the field of robotics, real-time feedback from explorer robots has proven invaluable, allowing for immediate adjustments and improvements.

However, the implementation of real-time features is not without its challenges. Serving multiple users instantly requires robust and efficient systems. Developers need to be well-versed in technologies such as Websockets and WebRTC, which facilitate real-time communication.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of real-time web applications are undeniable. They have the potential to significantly enhance user experience, improve communication, and provide instant feedback, making them an essential part of the modern web landscape.
