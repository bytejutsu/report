# Section 1.4: Proposed Solutions:

## 1.4.1: **Proposed Solutions for the Freemium Invoicing App:**

1. **Background Jobs for Invoice Generation:**
    - **Description:** Implement background processing to handle the generation of invoice PDFs. This ensures that the user's UI remains responsive and unblocked, even when generating complex invoices.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Improved user experience due to non-blocking UI.
        - Scalability, as multiple invoices can be processed simultaneously in the background.
        - Reduced chances of timeouts or server overloads during peak usage times.

2. **Web Servers & Database Storage:**
    - **Description:** Utilize robust web servers to deliver the app to users efficiently. Implement a relational or NoSQL database system to ensure user data persistence, including their profiles, business details, and generated invoices.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Reliable and fast access to the app.
        - Secure and structured storage of user data.
        - Easy retrieval and backup of user information and invoices.


### 1.4.2: **Proposed Solutions for the Simple Messaging App:**

1. **WebSockets for Real-time Communication:**
    - **Description:** Implement WebSockets to provide a real-time data feed to users. This allows for instantaneous message delivery and real-time status updates (e.g., online/offline status).
    - **Benefits:**
        - Seamless and instant communication between users.
        - Reduced latency compared to traditional polling methods.
        - Enhanced user experience due to real-time feedback and notifications.

2. **Web Servers & Database Storage:**
    - **Description:** Deploy the app using high-performance web servers to ensure smooth user access. Use a database system, preferably one optimized for real-time applications, to implement message and user data persistence.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Consistent and fast access to the messaging platform.
        - Secure storage of messages and user profiles.
        - Efficient retrieval of chat histories and user data.
