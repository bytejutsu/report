# Why Use Both a Web Server (Apache) and an Application Server (Laravel PHP Framework)?

If both a Web Server (for example Apache) and an Application Server (for example Laravel PHP Framework) can handle HTTP requests and respond back, why do we need them both? In other words, what can Apache do that the Laravel PHP Framework can't and vise versa?

## Apache Web Server

- **Connection Handling**: Apache is adept at handling a large number of simultaneous connections, which is essential for high-traffic websites.


- **Load Balancing and Reverse Proxy**: Apache can be configured as a reverse proxy and load balancer, distributing incoming requests across multiple application servers. This helps in scaling the application horizontally.


- **Serving Static Content**: Apache is highly efficient at serving static content such as HTML, CSS, and images. It can do this much faster and with lower resource usage compared to an application server like Laravel.


- **Security Features**: Apache provides a range of security features such as SSL/TLS encryption, access control, and protection against various types of attacks.

## Laravel PHP Framework (Application Server)

- **Business Logic Processing**: Laravel is designed to execute complex business logic, such as processing form data, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content.


- **Framework Features**: Laravel provides a rich set of features for web application development, including routing, authentication, ORM, and templating.


- **Customization and Flexibility**: Laravel allows for greater customization and flexibility in building web applications compared to Apache, which is more focused on serving content.

In a production environment a web application must be able to handle multiple HTTP requests and many of them are simultaneous. This is where a Web Server like Apache shines as it takes the responsibility to digest and handle those multiple requests, assign them to the appropriate Application Server process and then serve the resulting response back efficiently. 

That is why we have Application Servers like Laravel PHP Framework always running behind a Web Server like Apache. As their role is more focused towards applying the business logic to the incoming requests.

how many http requests can a single application server proccess handle and what is its life cycle?
