## 2.2 Web Server vs Application Server

Web Server and Application Server are both components used in web applications, they work in conjunction but serve different purposes. Let's compare them:

### Web Server

- **Primary Function**: A Web Server is primarily responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It serves static content like HTML, CSS, and images to the client's browser.


- **Processing**: Web Servers do not execute any business logic. They mainly deal with the delivery of web pages to the browser.


- **Examples**: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).


- **Scalability**: Web Servers are generally more scalable and are used to handle the high volume of traffic and static content.


- **Communication**: Web Servers communicate directly with the client's browser and can also act as a reverse proxy server for application servers.

### Application Server

- **Primary Function**: An Application Server is designed to run web applications and execute business logic. It is capable of dynamically generating content through scripts and database interactions.


- **Processing**: Application Servers execute complex business logic, transactions, and can also facilitate messaging services.


- **Examples**: Laravel PHP Framework, Apache Tomcat, WildFly, IBM WebSphere, Microsoft ASP.NET.


- **Scalability**: Application Servers are generally less scalable compared to web servers and are used for more resource-intensive operations.


- **Communication**: Application Servers usually communicate with web servers, which in turn communicate with the client's browser.

Web Servers are best suited for serving static content and handling HTTP requests, while Application Servers are used for executing business logic and generating dynamic content.

Both Web Servers and Application Servers are typically two different processes that operate independently on top of a Physical Server's operating system
